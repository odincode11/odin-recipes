    <h1>Chicken Wings</h1>

    <p>
        Chicken wings are white meat, even though they're juicier and have a more concentrated poultry flavor, like dark meat. Many people think of Buffalo wings when they think of this part of the chicken, and for good reason: they're extremely popular throughout the United States.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>10 chicken wings</li>

        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>

        <li>¼ cup butter</li>

        <li>¼ cup hot sauce</li>

        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>

        <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <p>
            <li>Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt.</li>
        </p>
            <li>Mix together flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika in a wide, shallow bowl. Press wings into flour mixture to coat and arrange onto a large plate with space between. Refrigerate coated wings for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <p>
            <li>Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate wings once more for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>        
        </p>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <p>
            <li>Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and juices run clear, 9 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </p>
            <li>Transfer fried wings to a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over wings and toss to coat.</li>
    </ol>
