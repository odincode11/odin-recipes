    <h1>Chicken Wings</h1>

    <p>
        Chicken wings are white meat, even though they're juicier and have a more concentrated poultry flavor, like dark meat. Many people think of Buffalo wings when they think of this part of the chicken, and for good reason: they're extremely popular throughout the United States.
